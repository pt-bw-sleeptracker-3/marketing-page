WEB Unit 1 Build
It’s time to put all your fundamentals to the test. Being able to combine HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Libraries, and Programming Paradigms into a project is a rare skill indeed.

The Web Foundations Unit explored the following topics:
User Interfaces 1 - 3
Git for Web Development
Responsive Design 1 - 2
Pre-Processors 1 - 2
JavaScript Fundamentals 1 - 4
For your project this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by working with a group of students cross-section to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) over the course of the week.

Your primary role User Interface Developer:
You will build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by your group and provides the user with details about the product your team has selected to build.
Your marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths. Please see the “Responsiveness” portion of your rubric for more information on this.
The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that your Front End Architect is building.
Your marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like “Netlify” or “Github Pages”.
For this Marketing site’s home page you need to have content and copy that relates to the product that your team is working on.
Descriptions about the product and about the features it provides would be key.
For a second page, you could do an about us section that includes images of the members of your team, and links to one another’s socials/Github.
Your Grading Rubric:
Please review this rubric and fully demonstrate an understanding of your product role by submitting a message to your Project Manager with questions you have.
